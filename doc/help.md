## Usage

 1. Start at the **Select** tab and choose a dataset. Here you may also review
    the annotations for each column in the dataset.

 1. Next go to **View** to see a table of the data and an automatically
    generated plot. This page allows filtering of the data and downloading of
    the filtered table.

 1. To build sophisticated plots, go to the **Plot** tab.

 1. To upload your own data, go to the **Upload** tab. You may upload either a
    single table, or a folder containing nested datasets. Details on upload
    formatting is available on the uploads page. **Note**: the Upload tab will
    not be present under certain configuations of Metaoku.
