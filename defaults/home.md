## Customize 

You are viewing the default home page. To customize, add a 'data/home.md'
markdown file to the working directory of your shiny app.

If you don't know how to write in markdown, here is [tutorial](http://markdowntutorial.com/).

This file should

 1. give an overview of the data
 2. provide a way to cite the data (if needed)
 3. provide contact info for the submitters
